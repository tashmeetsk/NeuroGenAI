# NeuroGenAI

A brain disease classification tool using CNN to analyze MRI images, combined with patient history via NLP and LLMs, to provide personalized treatment recommendations. The project aims to assist healthcare professionals with early diagnosis and tailored care plans.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get the application up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy, Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for testing and prototyping)

You can install the necessary Python packages by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tashmeetsk/neurogenai.git
   cd neurogenai
   ```

2. **Prepare Data**:
   - Download MRI datasets for brain diseases (glioma, meningioma, pituitary tumor, stroke, Alzheimerâ€™s, etc.).
   - Organize the data into separate folders for training and validation.
   - Ensure images are preprocessed to the same format and shape.


## Features

- **Multi-Disease Classifier**: A CNN-based classifier that detects multiple brain diseases, including tumors, strokes, and Alzheimer's Disease.
- **Custom Routing Layer**: A custom Keras layer that routes predictions to specialized models for further classification of tumors, strokes, or Alzheimer's subtypes.
- **Integration with LLM**: Leverages patient history and NLP for personalized treatment suggestions.
- **Modular Architecture**: Easily extendable to add new diseases and treatment plans.
